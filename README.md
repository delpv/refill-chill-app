# refill-chill-app - WIP

The web-app is build e2e. From the frontend perspective the user logs in, adds items to the cart and places an order. From the backend perspective we constructed a RESTful API with a local SQLite database connection for persistent data storage.

## Architecture considerations
- Frontend - React.js/TypeScript
- Backend - NodeJs/Express.js
- Database - SQLite

## Little disclaimer
- We are using an enterprise GitHub at ITU, and therefore, it's not possible to fork the repo here - which is why there is no history, since I need to copy paste the files.
